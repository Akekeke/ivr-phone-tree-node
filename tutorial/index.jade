      ## About this application

      ![Extra Terrestrial Phone Home
      Service](http://howtodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/logo-et-phone2.png)

      This Node.js [Express](//expressjs.com/en/index.html) sample application is
      modeled after a typical call center experience, but with more [Reese's
      Pieces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reese%27s_Pieces#ET:_The_Extra-
      Terrestrial).

      Stranded aliens can call a phone number and receive instructions on how
      to get out of earth safely, or call their home planet
      directly[.](http://bit.ly/asogi) In this tutorial, we'll show you the
      key bits of code to make this work.

      To run this sample app yourself, [download the code and follow the
      instructions on GitHub](https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/ivr-phone-tree-
      node).

      ## Respond to the Phone Call

      To initiate the phone tree, we need to configure one of our Twilio
      numbers to send our web application an HTTP request when we
      get an incoming call.

      [Click on one of your numbers](/user/account/phone-numbers/incoming) and
      configure the Voice URL to point to our app. In our code the route
      will be `/ivr/welcome`.

      ## Respond to the Twilio request with TwiML

      Our Twilio number is now configured to [send HTTP
      requests](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/twilio_request) to this
      controller method on any incoming voice calls. Our app responds with
      [TwiML](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml) to tell Twilio what to do
      in response to the message.

      In this case we tell Twilio to
      [`Gather`](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/gather) the input from
      the caller and we [`Play`](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/play) a
      welcome message.

      You may have noted the second argument we're passing after the URI segment
      in every route definition, e.g.:

      ```
      router.post('/welcome', twilio.webhook({validate: false}), function (request, response) {
          ...
      });
      ```
      That `twilio.webhook({validate: false})` call refers to [Twilio moduleâ€™s built-in
      Express middleware](//www.twilio.com/blog/2014/01/secure-your-nodejs-webhooks-with-middleware-for-express-middleware.html)
      , which makes slightly nicer to send back TwiML among other
      purposes, such as Twilio request validation.

    :markdown
      ## Where to send the caller's input

      The *gather's* `action` parameter takes an absolute or relative URL as a
      value - in our case, the `menu` endpoint.

      When the caller has finished entering digits Twilio will make a
      GET or POST request to this URL including a
      [`Digits`](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/gather#attributes-action-parameters) parameter with the number our caller chose.

      After making this request, Twilio will continue the current call using
      the TwiML received in your response. Any TwiML verbs occuring after a `<Gather>`
      are unreachable, unless the caller enters no digits.

    :markdown
      ## The Main Menu: Process the caller's selection

      The route `/ivr/menu` handles processing the caller's input.

      If our caller chooses '1' for directions, we use method defined
      below, [`giveExtractionPointInstructions`](//github.com/TwilioDevEd/ivr-phone-tree-node/blob/c0b1beaa37a962550b8b7c0586b7f52a67b02e00/routes/ivr.js#L51-L63),
      to respond with TwiML that will
      [`Say`](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/say) directions to our
      caller's extraction point.

      If the caller chooses '2' to call her home planet, then we need to
      gather more input from her. We wrote another method to handle this,
      [`listPlanets`](//github.com/TwilioDevEd/ivr-phone-tree-node/blob/c0b1beaa37a962550b8b7c0586b7f52a67b02e00/routes/ivr.js#L65-L77),
      which we'll cover in the next step.

      If the caller enters anything else we respond with a TwiML
      [`Redirect`](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/redirect) to the main
      menu.

      ## The Planet Directory: Collect more input from the user

      If our caller chooses to call her home planet we will tell her the planet
      directory. This is akin to a typical "company directory" feature of
      most IVRs.

      In our TwiML response we again use a `Gather` verb to receive our caller's
      input. The `action` verb points this time to the `planets` route, which
      will switch our response based on what the caller chooses.

      The TwiML response we return for that route just uses a
      [`Dial`](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/dial) verb with the
      appropriate phone number to connect our caller to her home planet.
